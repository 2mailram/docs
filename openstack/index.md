# Running CoreOS on OpenStack

CoreOS is currently in heavy development and actively being tested.
These instructions will walk you through downloading CoreOS for OpenStack.

## Download the Image

The latest production CoreOS OpenStack image can be [found here](http://storage.core-os.net/coreos/amd64-generic/dev-channel/coreos_production_openstack_image.img.bz2).

OpenStack is a flexible platform and accurately documenting image installation for
all OpenStack installs is really difficult. If you want to try your hand at it
please [fork this doc][fork-me] and send a pull request.

## Using CoreOS

Now that you have a machine booted it is time to play around. Check out
the [Using CoreOS][using-coreos] guide.
